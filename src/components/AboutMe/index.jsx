        I graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering in 2012 and completed
        a Masterâ€™s in Applied Informatics in 2014. I began my career as a web
        developer and as a professor of Mathematics and Statistics, roles I held
        until 2019, when I transitioned to working full-time as a software
        developer. I have developed software using PHP, .NET,
        JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python, leveraging libraries and frameworks
        such as Angular, React.js, Next.js, NestJS, ASP.NET, Django, FastAPI,
        Yii2, and Laravel. I have experience with various database management
        systems, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis and SQLite, as well
        as cloud providers like AWS and Google Cloud. Additionally, I have
        experience in Machine Learning using scikit-learn and PyTorch, working
        on regression and classification tasks.{" "}
